# Coding Playground

## Description

This repository is a central hub for my development experiments, course exercises, and small projects across multiple languages.

## Featured Projects by Language

### Go

- **Go Fundamentals**: A dedicated space for mastering Go. I use this folder to practice Go's idiomatic approach to software design, focusing on its unique composition, interfaces, and memory management to build clean and efficient applications.

### Java

- **Gomoku (Five in a Row)**: A fully functional, terminal-based Gomoku game. It features a robust Object-Oriented design and supports both local multiplayer and a challenging AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.

### C#

- **Flight Reservation System**: A C# console application demonstrating **robust Object-Oriented design** patterns. It uses a central Coordinator pattern to manage interactions between dedicated Flight, Customer, and Booking managers. Key features include local data persistence via custom file I/O serialization, rigorous input validation, and dynamic string manipulation for perfectly aligned terminal UI tables.

### LeetCode

- **Problem Solving Practice**: A growing collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems.
